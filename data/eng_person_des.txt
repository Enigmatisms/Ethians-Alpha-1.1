["Ah, the blade cometh from flame, and help me write down my fate.","When glory is covered by shade, and time cometh for the foes I hate.","Away from home down the rocky lane, might and power shall never wane.","Not know if I can return to my mate, nor shall there be King and Lord's aid.","On the darkness shall I raid, and all those killings will I make.", "What is the ultimate end? Is being gone and covered by dirt and sand?","The moment infant feet touch down on the land, with this question and answers no where to find.","Through out the years regarded as a crank, a solitary ranger needs no friend.","Fingers on the string and arrows at hand, peaceful message in bleeze will I send.","So what is ultimate end? Unitied with the darkness that I fend.","'Death lingers' by reaper I was told, 'Young age stays' was deemed before I was old.","Not obssessed by gold like those folks, nor my heart some cheap thing to be sold.","Torrent of war spawns tortured souls, Frigid bone rots along the road.","Axes too heavy and swords too cold, Weapon of mine not made in mould.","No more the corpses shall be what wives hold, no more will be the slaughter that all loath."]
